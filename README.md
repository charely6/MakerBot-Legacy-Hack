# MakerBot-Legacy-Hack
Repo to discuss/document researching and hacking older makerbot 3d printers 

I have been doing some research into hacking into an old makerbot replicator mini+ and I have found some info online about it but nothing yet to get complete access to the firmware or ways to use it with easily with other hardware besides people swapping out the control board

I don't know if this repo will go anywhere with this but I wanted to get it documented on the internet where I would be looking so if someone else out there is also looking they can find this.
